# Literate Testing
These are examples of how to use naming conventions and grouping to write unit tests in a highly readable manner,
resembling a specification so that the reader may gain a deeper understanding of the code being tested.

These examples are in fact from the talk "Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases" by Kevlin Henney

The tests and code are also developed [incrementally](https://github.com/arunbear/literatetesting/commits/main/) following the Test Driven Development approach.

## Examples
