# Literate Testing
Examples of writing unit tests in a highly readable manner, resembling a specification and aimed at aiding the reader in
gaining a deep understanding of the code being tested.

These examples are in fact from the highly educational talk "Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases" by Kevlin Henney
